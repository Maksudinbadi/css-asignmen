Q: how center block elements using css1 ?
Ans:
    positioning your element,such as buttons,content boxes,text and image,is what alignment is all abouts.
    aligning in web design is lining up the parts currextly or in a straight line.
    in certain web design strategies,alignments is deliberately broken to an asymmetrical design.
    to centrally align the block elements,we can simply make use of the <center>tag.
    all the elements within the <center> tag will be centrally.
