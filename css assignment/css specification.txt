Q: how maintain the css specifications ?
Ans:
    the css specification prior  to css was a single specification,css3
    on the other hand is divided into modules which are independent specification
    that can be worked on by different author at different paces,that's why we have
     selector level3 specification,css color 4,css backgrounds and so on.some of these modules are revisions of css2.1,
     and some newly created,but all fall under the banner of css3.
